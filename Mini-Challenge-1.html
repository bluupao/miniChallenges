	<p> My name is Paolo Miguel Ylag. I like to eat, spend time with my family and friends. I serve in our church, in the kids' church to be specific. I am a person who has a lot of faults but I try to improve on all of them. </p>
	<p> Here is a potato because I have nothing else to say </p>

	<a name = "video"/>
	<p> This is my favorite video. This video is about the life of the youtuber Markiplier. He does "Let's plays" in his videos. I chose this video because he cheers me up along with 5 million of his subscribers. So here, I hope you enjoy. </p> <br>
